                    My name is Logan Douglass.  I do a lot of things, but currently I am beginning my career as a web developer, data scientist, and software engineer.  My main project is writing data efficiency software for Ptarmigan Consulting LLC.  Prior to that, I taught philosophy for six years at Indiana University @ Bloomington, where I am a doctoral candidate.  As a philosophy professor, I taught a wide range of topics, including formal logic, philosophy of mind, and ethics (including contemporary business ethics).<br><br>

                    Outside of my professional life, I try to nourish a healthy range of skills and interests.  Music is one of my passions, and I have been playing guitar for over 14 years.  I am teaching myself keys as well as digital composition and production.  As a side project, I am writing software that can quickly compose large amounts of MIDI for several instruments at once.<br><br>

                    Beyond music, some of my other passions include martial arts and video gaming.  I have been gaming since I was 3-years-old, and have a reputation for being something of a Smash wiz.  Contact me if you're interested in content creation or preparation for professional play.
